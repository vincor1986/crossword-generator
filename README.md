# crossword-generator
SPA generates a random 10x10 crossword puzzle with clues.

Visit the app here: https://vincor1986.github.io/crossword-generator

The app randomly generates a 10x10 grid with symmetrical black spaces, then calls the datamuse API (https://www.datamuse.com/api/) to populate grid words, using definitions provided with API responses as clues.

The page will automatically reload if the build fails. A new crossword will be created on each page reload.
